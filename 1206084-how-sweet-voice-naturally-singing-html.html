Please reach us through info@corp.legit.ng!</strong></p><h4>Examine your current voice</h4><p class=align-left>Before trying to improve your voice, you need to understand your current voice. This includes an assessment of six main voice components.</p><ul><li><strong>Articulation: </strong>Do you slur your words or mumble?</li><li><strong>Overall pitch: </strong>Do you speak in a shrill, high tone or a deep, low pitch?</li><li><strong>Pitch variation:</strong> Do you speak in a monotone?</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> Do you speak too quickly or slowly?</li><li><strong>Voice quality: </strong>Is your voice nasally, breathy, or raspy?</li><li><strong>Volume: </strong>How loud do you speak?</li></ul><h4>Record your voice</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/15425c13fe724d0b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Most people have probably made recordings of themselves and got less than impressive results. Generally, a lot of people do not like the sound of their recorded voice. However, it is important to remember that your recorded sound is pretty close to what others hear when you speak.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a15e61d0d375f96d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pop your ears: Top 10 methods to try</span></p></a><p class=align-left>By recording yourself, you can easily understand the numerous details that comprise your vocal profile. These include speed, articulation, variation, pitch, quality, and volume. Once you assess your profile, take note of the flaws and decide the aspects you would want to improve.</p><h4>Get enough sleep</h4><p class=align-left>Whenever your body is fatigued, one of the most highly affected aspects is your voice. Typically, one is advised to sleep for 7-9 hours, even though this may vary from person to person. If you are sleeping for about 8 hours and still feeling fatigued in the morning, you might need to consult a medical professional.</p><h4>Relax</h4><p class=align-left>Stress is an enemy of a good voice. When trying to get a good singing voice, try and do away with situations, places, or anything else that might be causing a stress buildup. The best activities to reduce stress vary among individuals depending on personal preferences.</p><h4>Avoid screaming</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/db5e5f9d3a02f423.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Determine your vocal range using these quick and easy steps</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Screams have been known to harm a person's voice for anything from a few hours to a few days.</p><h4>Learn to relax your voice</h4><p class=align-left>When a person is relaxed, they speak from their diaphragm instead of their throat. The latter has been known to result in forced, harsh, and tense voices. To relax your voice, start by talking while placing your hand on your throat. This will help you gauge the presence of any tightness on the throat.</p><h3>Keeping your body in peak condition for the perfect voice</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/05ee50e59f5a766b.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is said that the physical state of your body plays a huge role in the quality of your voice. Singers are somewhat considered ‘athletes’ in that they constantly move the tiny muscles associated with voice projection and coordinated breathing.</p><p class=align-left>Here are some tips to keep your body in peak physical condition for a beautiful voice.</p><h4>Do yoga and stretching exercises frequently</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/90ce1f64876837c4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 good dares that you should definitely use</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Stretching and yoga are said to keep the spine free from injuries. Singers who do yoga are said to have better postures and, as a result, better voices. Additionally, yoga is also said to help relax the mind, thus reducing any stress build-up that would otherwise affect the voice adversely.</p><h4>Lifting weights</h4><p class=align-left>Weightlifting can be beneficial for singers but only when done correctly. Ideally, one needs strong abdominal and pectoral muscles to support a perfect breathing rhythm for the best voice. The pectoral muscles anchor the human larynx. Strengthening this group of muscles is said to result in enhanced tonal control.</p><h4>Pilates are excellent</h4><p class=align-left>Pilates is a low-impact workout meant to enhance flexibility, mobility, strength, and balance through controlled movements. This exercise lengthens the abdominal muscles, resulting in improved support on the diaphragm, resulting in improved vocal control.</p><h4>Aerobic exercises</h4><p class=align-left>Cardiovascular health is crucial for a good voice. First, your body needs to have the ideal lung capacity when performing. Your lungs are said to benefit greatly from aerobic exercises such as running, jogging, walking, and swimming. You could also try singing while running on a treadmill to practice tonal control and enhance vocal strength.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/deb631b5ebef21bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get over someone you love – best tips</span></p></a><h4>Try the Alexander Technique</h4><p class=align-left>The Alexander Technique was designed to remove muscular tension by releasing muscles (having them do nothing). <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The technique</a> is particularly useful for the ribs and diaphragm and is said to improve the balance of one’s throat and head.</p><p class=align-left>The technique results in a freer and fuller voice and vocal cords that are less susceptible to injury.</p><h4>Avoid cigarettes</h4><p class=align-left>The smoke from cigarettes irritates the vocal cords, resulting in a harsh voice.</p><h4>The Feldenkrais Method</h4><p class=align-left>This technique releases the body’s deep-seated tensions and softens its ligaments and muscles through coordinated subtle movements. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It is widely used</a> by actors, athletes and musicians to explore breath control, posture, and movement coordination.</p><h3>Master tonal control</h3><p class=align-left>Tonal control is one of the biggest elements of a good voice. Here is how to make your voice sweet and soft naturally by mastering tonal control.</p><h4>Control your breathing</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f5ddbd9182e2c25c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fall in love with these 50 inspirational dance quotes and sayings</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a15e61d0d375f96d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Breathing is essential for good sound projection. Start by taking deep breaths and then exhaling slowly. While doing this, count from 1 to 12 while using your abdominal muscles to project the sounds. Additionally, avoid tensing your larynx.</p><p class=align-left>When singing, you always want to breathe steadily and slowly through the diaphragm. Practice this by placing your hand on your stomach when breathing. Ensure that you can feel your stomach expand and contract with every inhalation and exhalation.</p><p class=align-left>To further control your breathing, learn to read sentences in a single breath. Have a mix of short and long sentences to make it more realistic. Exhale as you read out every sentence aloud. After you are done, breathe in and read the next sentence while exhaling slowly.</p><h4>Record and listen</h4><p class=align-left>The best way to master tonal control is by assessing how far you are from the ideal level. Then, when recording yourself, alter the tone to hear which version sounds like the best starting point. You can do this by incorporating the breathing exercises mentioned above into the recordings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/8af406a75c542b28.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 5 exercises on how to get a deeper voice</span></p></a><h4>Learn how to pitch your voice</h4><p class=align-left>To ensure that your audience is captivated, learn how to modulate your pitch so that your tone emphasizes what you are saying. Typically, low-pitched sounds are more pleasing to the human ear than high-pitched sounds.</p><p class=align-left>To develop pitch control, practice by humming <a href=#>different songs</a> in a low register.</p><h4>Learn the correct posture</h4><p class=align-left>Posture control is crucial when it comes to figuring out how to be a good singer. Your tone control is easily affected by your posture. Learn to stand straight so that your lungs can get full air capacity.</p><p class=align-left>Since breathing is crucial for the perfect tone and pitch, it goes without saying that a posture that enhances ideal breathing is important.</p><h4>Moderate and check your volume</h4><p class=align-left>If you are singing to a small crowd without the use of external sound amplifiers, you can exercise tonal control by saying a phrase and checking with your audience whether it was loud enough. Singing louder than the ideal level will result in a higher pitch, resulting in poor tonal control.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/363228423092c763.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is verbal communication so important for people?</span></p></a><h3>How to improve your singing voice professionally</h3><p class=align-left>At times, learning how to have a good voice requires one to engage the services of a professional.</p><h4>Listen keenly to good singers</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/db5e5f9d3a02f423.jpeg><p class=align-left>Download some songs from your favourite artist and take some time to really listen to their vocal delivery.

This explains why some recorded songs sound way better than their live performance versions. If you like a particular singer's recorded song, find out what sound editing has been done on the song and decide whether you can have the same on your songs.</p><h3>Foods for improving your singing voice</h3><p class=align-left>As with numerous other body-related issues, one's diet goes a long way in determining the quality of their voice. Here is a look at the foods to eat when trying to improve your singing voice.</p><h4>Water</h4><p class=align-left>Well, it's technically not food, but hands down, the most important thing to consume when learning how to have a beautiful voice. Try and substitute most beverages with water. These include soft drinks, coffee, alcohol, and milk.</p><p class=align-left>It is advisable to take room temperature water, not hot or cold.</p><h4>Unsalted crackers and toast</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/210f6c1f09d667b7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Useful healthy lifestyle tips for men</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These two foods help in improving hydration, an essential element of sounding good. "How?" You might ask. When you consume these two foods, the mouth is forced to produce more saliva to moisten and break them down. The end result is improved moisture around your vocal cords.</p><h4>Fresh fruits</h4><p class=align-left>Fruits such as apples and oranges have been known to do wonders for the human voice. This is due to their high fibre and vitamin content. Avoid consuming fruits in their juiced versions since these go directly into your bloodstream.</p><h4>Chicken</h4><p class=align-left>Chicken is a good source of protein and provides one with the energy needed for tonal and breathing control. Go for lean chicken cuts to avoid overwhelming your vocal cords with the oils and fats present in fatty cuts.</p><h4>Low-fat fish</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/a15873afefe2d722.jpeg><p class=align-left>These include pike, catfish, pollock, and hake. They contain sufficient protein levels but do not have too much fat. Consumption of excessively fatty fish can lead to indigestion and the removal of fluid from the body.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7941fe84632ec46d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Learn to sing better with these professional tips for men</span></p></a><h4>Honey</h4><p class=align-left>Add a spoonful of honey to your water or tea. The honey helps sooth your throat, resulting in a better tone and pitch. You can take the honey before you sleep, or immediately you wake up. However, keep in mind that honey has high sugar levels, so do not consume too much of it.</p><h4>Nuts</h4><p class=align-left>Nuts are amazing snacks <a href=#>for singers</a>. Feel free to consume your favourite ones; almonds, cashew nuts, groundnuts, or any other and then wash them down with some room temperature water.</p><h4>Cantaloupe</h4><p class=align-left>Also known as the rockmelon, the cantaloupe is a sweet variety of watermelon and has high water content. This fruit goes a long way to ensure your vocal cords remain hydrated for that sweet voice.</p><h3>Foods that can harm your singing voice</h3><p class=align-left>Here are some foods to avoid when trying to get a better singing voice.</p><h4>Dairy products such as milk, yoghurt, and cheese</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4f94c543a1ab972b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top characteristics of true love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dairy products are generally hard to break down and can easily result in acid reflux. Additionally, these products can result in thickening the mucus membranes that inhibit the vocal cords' flexibility, resulting in a bad tone.</p><h4>Chocolate</h4><p class=align-left>Yes, this yummy delight is not exactly good for your voice. Since chocolate naturally contains caffeine, it can result in dried up vocal cord muscles. Additionally, chocolate has been known to have significantly high sugar levels.</p><h4>Deep-fried foods</h4><p class=align-left>Most deep-fried foods tend to have very high oil contents. Consuming these foods results in excessive mucus production in the throat, which is bad for the voice.</p><h4>Butter</h4><p class=align-left>Butter is among the oiliest foods out there and greases up one's throat. This then results in the thickening of the mucus membrane on the throat, and as you might guess, that is not good for your voice.</p><h4>Ice water</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/90ce1f64876837c4.jpeg><p class=align-left>While room temperature water does wonder for your voice, ice water has the opposite effect.
