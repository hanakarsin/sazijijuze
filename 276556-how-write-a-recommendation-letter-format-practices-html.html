It is also known as a reference letter. A letter of recommendation is considered confidential as it is requested by a particular person, and is therefore specifically addressed to the interested party or parties. Mostly, they are addressed to employers about the new employees they intend to employ, touching on their capacity to perform, their character traits, and their qualities. A recommendation letter for job is not just an employment reference. It can also be written for business institutions, such as suppliers seeking a win over other companies; over contracts and tenders, highlighting the qualities of their deliveries and their reliability. Higher learning institutions also require a reference letter for students from their previous learning institutions, before getting them absorbed into their institutions, and for checking the eligibility of scholarships for sponsored students. An employer can also write in recommendation of an intern at the completion of his or her internship at the firm, and an intern’s assessor or lecturer can also write recommending them to a company to be incorporated as interns, or showing that they are students of a given learning institution. Below is a guideline on how to write a letter of recommendation.</strong></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d822555154126bb7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A comprehensive guide on how to write reminder email effectively</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d822555154126bb7.jpeg><h2>How is a recommendation letter written?</h2><p class=align-left>Before putting pen on paper and writing this kind of letter, one needs to understand how it is written first. First of all, one has to know that the document is a formal type of a letter and it is addressing a particular person, with a specific reason for requesting for it. For this reason, they are majorly short and straight to the point. There are no greetings in this type letter at any costs.</p><h3>What to consider when writing a recommendation letter</h3><h4>1. Objectify the recommendation</h4><p class=align-left>You should suggest the main objective for the recommendation, is it for an academic post, a job, an optional position, a background level, or an individual reference? Write a letter which is entirely focused on this objective. For instance, if the recommendation letter is part of a student application letter, it is required to focus on the academic level qualifications and competence of the candidate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e182f2ceff3ff22c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a petition letter (with samples)</span></p></a><h4>2. Get to know the position well</h4><p class=align-left>If you are able to get your hands on the job description, please do so, and if you are in a position to talk to the person you are writing about, it is highly recommended to do so in order to get the full picture of the person. If you are familiar with the person, ask them more about the intended position. The more you familiarize yourself with the information, the more you are likely to write the letter in the most unique way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs5sujd6926rf.jpeg><h4>3. Research on the person you are recommending</h4><p class=align-left>When writing a recommendation letter, take a little bit of time to talk to the person you are recommending. Gather as much information about their dreams, goals, hobbies, and much concerning the position they are applying for. Take their curriculum vitae and any additional information about them that will enable you to write the letter with competence. The best recommendation letters are the ones which have been researched on severely and are specific to the point, having all the necessary information.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/38a95e83264b4477.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a report (with samples)</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e182f2ceff3ff22c.jpeg><h3>Recommendation letter format</h3><p class=align-left>The standard formal convention of letter writing is used while writing a reference letter, just like any other professional letter. The rules governing its writing are as follows:</p><ul><li>Put down your own address on the top right hand of the document, beginning with your name. Follow your address with the date.</li><li>On the left, below your address, write the address of the recipient. If the recipient’s name is known, make sure you put it down.</li><li>Open the letter with a formal business greeting.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs1ccuv0krrdu.jpeg><ul><li>Open the letter with a little bit of praise</li></ul><p class=align-left>When writing the letter, make sure to start with a short phrase/paragraph of praise about the person you are writing about. You don't have to overdo it or be insincere, being positive makes a big difference in the whole view of the person you are writing about. Praises are convenient in order to make the reader feel like you personally know the person on a certain level.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cc0380835bed8a28.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A step by step guide for writing an awesome attachment letter</span></p></a>"I am entirely overjoyed to be in a position of recommending Gladys for the Senior Accountant position in your company""Company XYZ should be glorified to have an employee such as Kennedy, who is talented, enthusiastic, and clever in all ways"<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/38a95e83264b4477.jpeg><ul><li>Briefly state how you know the person</li></ul><p class=align-left>You should let the recipient know your qualification, how you met the person, and how you interacted with him/her.

Most employers tend to write recommendation letters for their employees if they did competent work. The following is a former employee recommendation letter sample.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs6i4h0etmlqf.jpeg><h2>Sample recommendation letter for student</h2><p class=align-left>In colleges, campuses, and mostly in private schools, the major admission officers tend to be strict, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive recommendation letter. This process is vital in knowing the student as a 'whole person', rather than focusing on pieces of who she is based merely on the grades she presents and test scores. This is due to the fact that the admission officers haven't met the student in person, and the student's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recommendation letters</a>, along with their own personal essay, play a huge role in irradiating her intellectual and personal qualities. The following is an example of a sample recommendation letter for a student joining a new institution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2nm0umfb929.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a verification of employment letter</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3881ea1f874b263d.jpeg><h2>Sample recommendation letter for internship completion</h2><p class=align-left>Most students, after the completion of their internship, require recommendation letters in order to start a well-paying job in a firm or a company.
