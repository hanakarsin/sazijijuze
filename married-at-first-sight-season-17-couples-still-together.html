p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler Warning: This article contains spoilers for Season 17 of </strong><strong>Married at First Sight</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Season 17 of <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a><strong> </strong>features just four newly married couples at first. But later, we see Michael matched with someone new, Chloe, following his runaway bride incident. And it all makes you wonder who is still together after <a href=#>Season 17</a> of MAFS. After Decision Day, we have a clearer idea of which couples really weren't right for each other.</p><p>The <a href=#>success rate</a> for couples on the show isn't exactly high, but there have been long-lasting marriages and even babies that came from the Lifetime series. So before you judge the experts for certain matches they make, let's try and remember that for some participants, the experiment really does work out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><p>So, who is still together after MAFS Season 17 and who didn't find themselves cut out for marrying a total stranger? Read on to find out, but be warned, because the details after Decision Day for some of these couples are pretty revealing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Clare and Cameron get off to a rough start.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Madison Leigh Creative</span></figure><p>Clare and Cameron seem like a solid couple at first, but in the days that follow their wedding, they have small issues that turn into much bigger ones. They split up before Decision Day, but they still meet with the experts to go over what went wrong. Cameron knows he messed up "the process" through trying to take control, he tells Clare. He also says, "Whatever attraction I had for you is gone…when I look at you, I see a family member, I see a sister."</p><p>And Clare seems to feel the same way. She says she is "grateful" for the experience with Cameron, but she too recognizes that they aren't right for each other. She wants a different kind of love, but she still cares about Cameron deeply. They both say no to staying together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lauren and Orion seem to be the perfect couple at first.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Poppy & Co. by Kelsey Huffer</span></figure><p>Both Orion and Lauren have strong personalities and they both hold their family values close to them. So by all accounts, they should be a near perfect match. However, from some offensive comments on their honeymoon to Orion not feeling the the connection is there anymore, these two decide to throw in the towel early. They don't even get an official Decision Day send-off.</p><p>They do meet back up in a following episode, but they aren't together now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Becca and Austin have an immediate mutual attraction.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Delacastros Colorado Wedding Photographers</span></figure><p>One thing MAFS participants worry about is not being attracted to their match or their match not finding them good looking. For Becca and Austin, that's not the case. However, all is apparently not what it seems, because Becca accuses Austin of putting on a show for cameras numerous times. They make it to Decision Day and they both say yes, regardless.</p><p>"I want to say no to where this marriage has been, but I wanna say yes to where it could be," Becca explains.</p><p>But that's not where things end for these two.</p><p>Becca shares in the March 6 episode of MAFS that she's hurt by Austin going out with Brennan and a female producer behind her back. Becca says, "All I wanted in Austin was the one person who would be true to you in all of this," but she didn't find that in him. Although they say yes on Decision Day, their break-up does come after.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Emily and Brennan are fast BFFs.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Delacastros Colorado Wedding Photographers</span></figure><p>Although Emily and Brennan develop a bond early and they have undeniable chemistry, apparently, it's not enough. After Emily's ATV accident, they grow closer together for a short time. But Brennan's lack of attraction for his new wife is enough to drive a wedge between them. But by Decision Day, they're already living separately and, unsurprisingly, they both say no to remaining together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Michael and Chloe get married after the other couples.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><p>Michael is the first person in the show's history to be left at the altar by his match. However, he is later matched with another person, Chloe, who he marries. Because they get married after the other couples, their Decision Day comes later. However, unfortunately for the,, they both aren't ready to continue with marriage together. And in the end, on their Decision Day, they break up.</p><p>Fans didn't exactly expect all of the Season 17 Couples to make it beyond Decision Day, since past seasons of MAFS have shown us that the success rate isn't high. But it was still disappointing for many that none of the matches worked out in the end.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zvsiem2aZpGKzqr7SrWSsoZedwW6%2FxJqqqKZdZoRur86up6Wdo2LAtbXLpWStp5eawamx0Q%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./stephen-sondheim-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Stephen Sondheim - Trivia, Family, Bio</a>
