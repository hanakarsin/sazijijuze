Something compelled me to do those tricks," <a href=#>the father of four </a>stated, before enthusiastically stressing that the ratio between what he gave in order to successfully pull off a trick was significantly lopsided.</p><p>"[I had an] obsession with perfecting [those] moves, sometimes practicing for years just to get it right one time," Tony added smiling.</p><p>Nothing in his being or the trajectory of his life seems to express an ounce of regret he's had in practicing a single move for years, in some instances, just to land it right once.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tony admits his dedication to skateboarding takes time away from his family.</h2><p>The subject of family comes up often in Tony's documentary, and when asked what impact he believes the personal dedication he's placed in skateboarding had on his children, the 16-time X-Games winner said that he hopes he "lead[s] by example" for his children, before stating that sometimes his obsessiveness for training may take him away from his children.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Facebook | @Tony Hawk</span></figure><p>"Sometimes training might take me away from my family," he admitted, before discussing his decision to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">return to the X-Games.</a> In 2021, Tony ran from the announcers' table and jumped on a vert ramp at 52 years old trying, over and over again, to land a frontside cab revert, a trick he landed only once in competition in 1995.</p><p>"When I decided to get back into skateboarding [professionally competing] I had to work twice as hard. My body didn’t heal like it used to. I needed to perform strength and conditioning work just to attempt to pull off those moves," he shared.</p><p>The idea of sticking to a training regimen outside of pure skateboarding was something foreign to him decades ago: "I never did strength and conditioning work when I was younger," Tony admitted.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a><p>Tony with his kids Riley, Keegan, and Kady, and his wife Catherine.</p></figure><p>The desire to consistently challenge himself, Tony said, fuels him: "I still have that drive in me to keep skating and keep trying stuff," even though he isn't a young man any longer.</p><p>He acknowledges that this "takes times away from my family," but it appears that Tony's admission of this lends itself to more gratitude towards skateboarding and his time in general.</p><p>"That risk factor that I generally ignore [I can't anymore]." He admitted that while he does "have this skill set [that] every once in a while [a trick] goes bad. That came with a very important reality check.
