Well, women constantly have to worry about their safety, especially when <a href=#>going out alone</a>. They must be aware of their surroundings and always carry some sort of self-defense product, whether it's pepper spray or a key ring.</p><p>In <a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@aliciamaeholloway</a>'s case, she didn't have either of those with her when two people tried to break into her hotel room ‚Äî and it's safe to say she was terrified. Read on for Alicia's story.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman revealed that two guys tried to break into her hotel room.</h2><p>In a text overlay of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viral video</a>, which has amassed over 1.3 million views on TikTok, the TikToker wrote, "Someone tried to break into my hotel room this weekend in Rochester, N.Y." She started off by saying she was judging a dance competition in Rochester, and after it ended, she went up to her hotel room and two guys tried to break in.</p><p>Alicia said she was FaceTiming with her boyfriend when they heard a "massive thud" on her hotel room door. He asked what happened, and she told him it "sounded like someone threw their entire body into my door." A few seconds later, someone started yanking on the handle and "slamming their body" against the door to try and open it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aliciamaeholloway href=#>@aliciamaeholloway</a><p>The scariest experience of my entire life.

"It was unclear what they were saying, I couldn't tell if they were drunk or foreign, but they were slamming the door ... trying to get in my room. It was hands down the most terrifying five minutes of my entire life."</p><p>Alicia eventually called 911, and while they were on their way, she also reached out to one of her fellow judges, Tristan, and told him what was happening. Thirty seconds before the police and Tristan arrived, Alicia heard the two guys run away. As she cried, she wondered if the two guys were drunk and tried to get into the wrong room. However, she soon realized that "there's no way that's the case when they were knocking and banging on the door so aggressively."</p><p>Alicia ended the video by claiming the situation "got even more terrifying" once the police arrived. Luckily, in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up video</a>, she explained why it got more frightening ‚Äî they asked if she had a stalker.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok /@liannjones1</span></figure><p>"When I tell y'all that my whole world just crumbled; I just had the most terrifying feeling," she said. "My first thought was, 'Oh my god, I literally posted a video earlier that day saying I was judging a dance competition in Rochester.'"</p><p>Alicia also noted that her encounter with the police was scary because there were no cameras. She recalled the front desk woman telling her that the hotel didn't have cameras in the hallways, which really freaked her out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aliciamaeholloway href=#>@aliciamaeholloway</a><p>Replying to @BekkiAnne The level of anxiety and paranoia was insane.

I understand, obviously in the rooms there shouldn't be hotel cameras, but [there should be in the hallway]," Alicia said. "It's 2023, <a href=#>Holiday Inn</a> needs to get with the program."</p><p>She added, "The amount of paranoia I felt was truthfully insane."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok /@karenheart44</span></figure><p>As expected, many fellow TikTokers took to the comment sections of both videos to express how sorry they were that Alicia had to experience something so traumatizing.
