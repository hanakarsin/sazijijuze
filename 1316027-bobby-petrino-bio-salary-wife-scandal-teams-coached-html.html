He left the job for another one at Weber State College. He continued between these two teams until 1989 when he became a quarterback coach at the University of Idaho, who had just hired a new head coach. Bobby Petrino, who was aiming to one day become a head coach like his father, did not rest on his oars. He went on to coach at Arizona State University where his team played in the pac-10 conference.</p><p class=align-left>He served as a mentor to Jack Plummer, who eventually became an all American Quarterback. Besides, in his early days as a coach, Petrino was either an offensive or a quarterback coach. He led the Louisville Cardinals. The team ranked top in the Division 1A for scoring and total fence. Interestingly, in 1999, he landed his first-ever National Football League coaching opportunity with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. He doubled as the coach of the Quarterbacks and as an offensive coordinator before he eventually left them 2001.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cfd03231d60ee4bc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kirk Herbstreit biography: age, family, salary, net worth, house</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bobby Petrino's dream of becoming a head coach was later achieved in 2003 when he returned to Louisville. He was there for four years and achieved unprecedented feats with the Cardinals. In 2007, the coach became the head coach of a new team, Atlanta Falcons, in the National Football League. He signed a five-year deal in the tune of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24 million</a> and replaced Jim Mora. He, however, did not see out his contract as he left for Razorbacks Arkansas.</p><p class=align-left>Like before, he did an excellent job with the team by winning several competitions, among which was the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas. The team ended the 2011 season with just two loses, which was significant in the club’s history. After spending close to five years with Arkansas, Bobby Petrino felt the urge for a new challenge. Western Kentucky signed him as head coach. He spent over a year before returning to Louisville Cardinals on a seven-year contract valued at about $30.625 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9c7b538769730f52.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Matt Smith bio: who is the talented actor who played the Eleventh Doctor?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Cardinals initially enjoyed a good run of form under Bobby Petrino, but their performance dwindled in 2018 after the team’s dominant quarterback decided to go for the National Football League. This led the team’s Director of Athletics, Vince Tyra, to fire him. Bobby Petrino past teams coached have benefitted immensely from his wealth of knowledge about the game. His robust resumé testifies to this fact.</p><h2>Bobby Petrino scandal</h2><p class=align-left>Bobby Petrino motorcycle accident on the Arkansas highway in April 2012 revealed his adulterous relationship with his assistant who served as the development coordinator. Bobby Petrino motorcycle was speeding on the highway with his mistress, Jessica Dorrell, when the incident happened.</p><p class=align-left>Bobby Petrino neck brace pictures, which surfaced in the media the next day, attracted a lot of sympathy from sports lovers but it did not last long.

Today, I've acknowledged this previous inappropriate relationship with my family and those within the athletic department administration<p class=align-left>Bobby Petrino mistress, Jessica Dorrell, was formerly working with the team's fundraising committee. At some point, she became the coach's assistant after what has since been described as a questionable interview process. The affair started <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">before she was hired</a> as Bobby Petrino's assistant and suggested favouritism during the process of hiring her.</p><p class=align-left>This incident and many others, which were revealed during the investigation of the coach by his employer, contravened the terms of his contract. Bobby Petrino affair and other following events caused the Arkansas razorbacks board of directors to review Bobby's contract. He was later sacked after being placed on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">paid leave</a> for an indeterminate amount.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99e6c2acc4ac241b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The interesting life story of Carl Weathers: His net worth, love life, and more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bobby Petrino has moved on with his life since the scandal and has gone to be the head coach of various teams.
