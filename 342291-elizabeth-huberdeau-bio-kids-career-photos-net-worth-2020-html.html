She appears to be a rather private person with little being known about her early life and family. She attended Springfield College, located in Massachusetts. She chose to major in business management.</p><p class=align-left>It appears this is one thing she has in common with her ex-husband since John also attended this college and graduated with a degree in Exercise Physiology and Body Movement. Interestingly, the two first met at the institution.</p><p class=align-left>Elizabeth is a shy lady who has focused on her personal life. Except for her marriage to John Cena, people know just a little bit of her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/04fb4b03cd772d72.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Deborah Kiley cause of death and life story: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The public got to hear of her after Cena proposed to her while promoting the movie <i>12 Rounds</i>. The two stood the test of time since they had been lovers way back from their teenage years. Elizabeth Huberdeau and John Cena wedding was held on 11 July 2009. It was a closely acquainted wedding that took place in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><h3>John Cena divorce</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Just like any other celebrity couple, it was imagined and assumed that the two would stay married. Unfortunately, the marriage between the two did not turn to be the "happily ever after " they expected it would be. Like it is with most couples, the two had differences that they could not solve as a couple.</p><p class=align-left>They called off their marriage after three years of being together. The two were supposedly having fights over the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">remodelling of their home. </a>Another reason for their divorce could be infidelity, as speculated by Huberdeau as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported by TMZ. </a>However, these claims remained unsubstantiated. The couple was officially divorced in July 2012.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Cree Cicchino bio: measurements, dating history, twin sister, parents</p><p class=align-left>Since their divorce, John Cena’s ex-wife chose to go silent and has not been sharing details of her personal life in any of her social media pages.</p><p class=align-left>Huberdeau is said to have moved on, and rumours have it that she is living with her<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> boyfriend, Eli Ayoub.</a> There aren't a lot of known details about the boyfriend, but Elizabeth Huberdeau pictures posted on social media indicate that the two have more than friendship.</p><h3>John Cena ex-wife settlement</h3><p class=align-left>Huberdeau and John Cena kept their divorce settlement confidential and private. However, they managed to talk about it and made ends meet. The two appear to have amicably settled their differences and are in good terms.</p><h3>Elizabeth Huberdeau net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/04fb4b03cd772d72.jpg><p class=align-left>How much is Elizabeth Huberdeau worth? Despite not much being made public about her professional and career life, she seems to be doing great. Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth value </a>and wealth is an interest to many people, especially because she was the wife of the wealthiest and most popular profession wrestlers. It is expected that she got quite a substantial amount after the divorce.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d83858206b13fdf0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jennifer Syme: The tragic life and death of Keanu Reeves' ex-girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The source of her income if any, and how also much she gets for it is an interesting topic for the people that have heard of her. Huberdeau was working as a real estate agent even before getting married to John Cena, which means that she depended on her own money too. The real estate business seems to be doing so well to earn her the strongly desirable life she leads.</p><p class=align-left>After the divorce, Huberdeau is said to have walked away with a handsome deal as a settlement package from her $ 55 million<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> net worth husband</a>. As of 2020, Huberdeau’s net worth was ranging at $ 10 million though she is believed to have reached this height after receiving the handsome settlement package from Cena.</p><h3>Does Elizabeth Huberdeau have kids?</h3><p class=align-left>As expected of any couple, children are always in the picture. People would wish to find out if a couple has children. This becomes more interesting to the public if the couple is a celebrity who has a great following. Sadly, they had no child of their own.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7c8f0f39d42f9399.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Womer: children, Jim Carrey, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>John Cena is believed not to have had an interest in having children. He basically desired a family of two mature adults. As far as Huberdeau is concerned, this was no issue. It appears as if the two were contented and not bothered with the issue.</p><p class=align-left>Although Cena has not had any child, the affection he portrays towards children is evident. His passion for the sick and suffering is stunning. This has always made fans wonder about him not having children despite the affection he expresses to them.</p><p class=align-left>Elizabeth Huberdeau was John Cena's ex-wife. While she lived a rather private life before her divorce, she is one of the few people attached to celebrity partners that became famous when her relationship ended. At least the world got to know about Cena's former wife.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>MLB host Lauren Shehadi biography: nationality, dating, salary, net worth</li><li>Troy Gentile bio: weightloss, girlfriend family, net worth</li><li>Mickey Rourke - What happened and latest health updates</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fk2tpcmldmrmqxsCbnK2gXZ3Co7HRnZyarV2XtrB5yqKbrGWTlr%2BmsdFmp6GnpKTAbrrErWSwp6KptW5%2Bj2tnZ6Ckork%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-it-ends-with-us-a-true-story.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is It Ends With Us Inspired by True Events?</a>
