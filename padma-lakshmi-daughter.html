Dell and Theodore J. Forstmann. But things took a new turn when Padma gave birth to her daughter, Krishna Thea Lakshmi-Dell, in February 2010.</p><p>As a previous article by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> claims, Padma learned that Adam was the father of the baby during the pregnancy, but she wanted to start a family with Teddy instead.</p><p>The plan didn't bode all that well with Adam, who swiftly sought to rectify the not-so-advantageous predicament.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Adam hit Padma with a court case in January 2011. In an explosive document, he raised allegations about the nature of their relationship — accusing her of using unkind language to describe him, among others — while also demanding child custody and for Krishna's last name to be changed to Dell.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Reportedly, Padma once called Adam "unambitious" and his career "uninteresting," while she also described his friends as "unmemorable." What's more, she chose Krishna's second name, Thea, because she supposedly wanted to pay homage to Teddy.</p><p>In 2021, Padma admitted on People’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Me Becoming Mom</a> podcast that the public paternity battle between her, Adam, and Teddy was “mortifying” to witness in the press. She described the brouhaha as “icky” due to the media’s “obsession” with her daughter’s father.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Padma lovingly refers to he daughter Krishna as "Littlehands" on social media.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, away from the chaos, Padma said Krishna, whom she often refers to as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Littlehands”</a> on social media, has been “the real star in the family" since she gave birth to her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I’m a fan of my daughter’s creativity,” Padma told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> in 2020. “She is wildly entertaining and funny and a great singer. … Krishna’s hysterical. I have to resist the temptation to put her on my social media all the time because I don’t think that’s right, but it’s hard because she’s really, genuinely funny!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adam gained recognition as Krishna's father in the end.</h2><p>It's understood that Padma and Adam settled the case out of court in the spring of 2012. As part of the agreement, Adam's last name was added to Krishna's name. Adam was able to strike up a more reasonable compromise when it came to visitation rights as well, earning the opportunity to spend more time with his daughter. Padma likely continued to have a say in the most important matters, however.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Padma basically said it was fine to add his name, but she retains all decision-making power, which is really what matters most to her," a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> at the time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Padma and Adam rekindled their romance in 2017, but split in 2021.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Padma and Adam sparked dating rumors once again in January 2017, when they attended the Women's March on Washington together.</p><p>Eager to take things slow and gradually rebuild their relationship, the couple stayed away from the spotlight for the most part. Padma shared the photograph she took of Adam at the Women's March on Washington a year later, on Valentine's Day in 2018 — which aroused some suspicion about their relationship status.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although they tend to be secretive about their private life, they did make headlines on a few occasions in the course of the past few years.</p><p>In the spring of 2019, a leisurely walk around Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood gave way to engagement rumors — as Padma was photographed with a sizeable sparkler on her left-hand ring finger. It's understood that <a href=#>Padma and Adam spent</a> the COVID-19 lockdown period together as well. However, the two reportedly split by early 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Padma pregnant again?</h2><p>There is no evidence to suggest that Padma is currently expecting, but she has certainly been the subject of pregnancy rumors before. In fact, the Bravolebrity took to Instagram in 2016 to shut down any speculation after she posted a picture of her in a bikini while vacationing with Krishna in Tulum, Mexico.</p><p>“No I am not pregnant, I just like tacos, and burritos and enchiladas...!!!” Padma clarified in her post.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The host has also previously shared why she’s likely not ready to carry another baby after her “very scary” pregnancy with Krishna. During her 2021 Me Becoming Mom podcast interview, Padma said she was diagnosed with placenta previa during her pregnancy, which “is a condition where the placenta lies low in the uterus and partially or completely covers the cervix,” per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Pregnancy Association</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Padma said her condition left her bedridden, and she could only take a shower “every three days” and “go to the bathroom twice a day.” She also shared that she was diagnosed with endometriosis at age 36, which made conceiving her daughter naturally “very difficult, if not impossible.” Still, Padma persevered because she knew she wanted to have a baby one day.</p><p>“That put the issue very front and center in my mind, and I was devastated,” she revealed of her diagnosis. “I really didn’t know if I was going to be able to have children, and I knew I wanted to have children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6lucBmo5qjo526qnnDmqygoKSavw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./trump-pr-towels.html>&#171;&nbsp;Photo Of Trump Tossing Paper Towels Into Crowd In Puerto Rico Goes Viral</a>
