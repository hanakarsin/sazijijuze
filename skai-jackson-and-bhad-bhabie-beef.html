And why did their moms got involved? See a breakdown of their history and bitter feud.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Disney Channel star <a href=#>Skai Jackson</a> is in the middle of a brand new feud, and this time, it's not with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Azealia Banks</a>. Internet personality <a href=#>Bhad Bhabie (Danielle Bregoli<strong>)</strong> </a>has got a serious bone to pick with the actress, and apparently, it all started with one shady comment on social media. It has escalated to the point where even their mothers have gotten involved. And now Skai has been granted a restraining order against the rapper. But how did it get to this point? Let's start from the beginning.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Skai and Danielle were allegedly feuding in 2018, but Skai debunked those rumors.</h2><p>On her Instagram stories, Danielle shared a post that read: "Lil miss Disney better stop the sneak dissing." She didn't call anyone by name, but most of her followers suspected that she was talking about Skai, even though the actress is actually a year older than the rapper.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>It's possible that Skai shared a cryptic message to social media around that time, which prompted Danielle to share that post and caused fans to put two and two together. However, it's unclear what the actress might've said to offend her... assuming she was even addressing the rapper.&nbsp;</p><p>When Skai caught wind of the rumors, she quickly shut them down and said that she and Danielle were actually "cool." So it seems like their apparent "feud" ended as quickly as it began.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Over a year later, Danielle went on a rant about wanting to fight Skai and threatened her.</h2><p>Fans assumed that all was good between the two until Danielle took to social media to vent about Skai "talking s--t on her little page again." On her Instagram Story, she posted: "Still can’t keep my name out of her mouth, SMH. This Disney thot wanna play… OK baby, let’s play then."</p><p>The 16-year-old also livestreamed her entire rant, where she claimed that Skai was obsessed with her, then went on to threaten the actress.</p><p>She said: "Why are you so obsessed with me, b---h? I will literally kill you. I don’t know why you’re not understanding that. You’re so small, if I get my hands on you… it’s over, you’re going to the hospital."</p><p>The rapper also claimed that she and Skai had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feuded</a> over her ex-boyfriend, NBA YoungBoy, in the past. In another rant, she said: "I’m finna go to jail behind a Disney thot… What is you even doing in these men’s DMs? You ain’t even like that.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Chile!! #BhadBhabie was out here calling out #SkaiJackson last night, meanwhile Skai is out here booked, unbothered and a whole mood!!

As an added bonus, she also added that she has no time for negativity.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Book doing pretty well✔️<br>Finalizing makeup deal✔️<br>Shopping treatment to major studios & producers✔️<br>Working on speech for Ted Talk✔️<br>Going over scripts✔️<br>Recording Netflix animated series✔️<br>Vlogging for my YouTube channel✔️<br>Hosting 18,000 youth for We Day✔️<br>No time 4 negatives!🚫</p>— Skai (@skaijackson) <a href=#>February 25, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Skai's mom and Danielle's mom got involved in the feud.</h2><p>Danielle thought that it would be a smart idea to come at Skai's mom and throw shade, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiya Cole</a> wasn't having it. In response to Danielle's comment, she not only demanded that she leave Skai alone, but also suggested talking to Danielle's mother about it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Danielle's mom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbara Ann Bregoli</a>, wasted no time in taking up the challenge, because she hopped right into the comments to fire back at Kiya, saying that she should tell her daughter to "stop speaking on mine."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>After the heated exchange took place, Danielle said on her Instagram Story: "Bro, this lil girl got her momma coming at me. Wow, she dead a-- that scared."&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, her mom actually shared the entire conversation to her page, then proceeded to post a tabloid snapshot of Skai apparently being "exposed." She said: Just found this very interesting @kiyacole.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Skai filed and receiving a restraining order against Danielle.</h2><p>Considering that Danielle said she would "literally kill" Skai, the young actress took the threat to heart and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a restraining order</a> against the rapper. In the filing, she said that she's afraid to leave her house alone and hasn't slept well since the threats started. She's also concerned that Danielle is mentally unstable.</p><p>She was granted the restraining order which forces Danielle to stay 100 yards away from her, her home, and her workplace. It also prevents her from contacting her in any way. Danielle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded on Instagram</a> saying, "Go get your restraining order, Imma go get checks," in a post that she somehow turned into a Fashion Nova ad.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLiitYyjmJyjo6S7bq3NnWSboJGZeqO0wJugnmWSmrKn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./breaking-tinubu-arrives-buharis-hometown-officially-confirms-shettima-as-running-mate-video.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tinubu Arrives Buhari's Hometown, Officially Confirms Shettima As Running Mate</a>
